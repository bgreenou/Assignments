***** LIMITATIONS ***** 

    This program is known to have the following limitations:

    - This program is a game that can only be played by two players

    - The only options those players have are the game total (typically a number between 0-100), R/r or H/h for roll or hold

    - The program reads only integers, and if you do not press R/r or H/h, the program will simply say "You messed up."

    -  The program stops once game total is reached. To play a new game, the program would have to be run again
